    "text": "I had the same thought so I've been playing with it in nanochat. E.g. here's 8 agents (4 claude, 4 codex), with 1 GPU each running nanochat experiments (trying to delete logit softcap without regression). The TLDR is that it doesn't work and it's a mess... but it's still very pretty to look at :)\n\nI tried a few setups: 8 independent solo researchers, 1 chief scientist giving work to 8 junior researchers, etc. Each research program is a git branch, each scientist forks it into a feature branch, git worktrees for isolation, simple files for comms, skip Docker/VMs for simplicity atm (I find that instructions are enough to prevent interference). Research org runs in tmux window grids of interactive sessions (like Teams) so that it's pretty to look at, see their individual work, and \"take over\" if needed, i.e. no -p.\n\nBut ok the reason it doesn't work so far is that the agents' ideas are just pretty bad out of the box, even at highest intelligence. They don't think carefully though experiment design, they run a bit non-sensical variations, they don't create strong baselines and ablate things properly, they don't carefully control for runtime or flops. (just as an example, an agent yesterday \"discovered\" that increasing the hidden size of the network improves the validation loss, which is a totally spurious result given that a bigger network will have a lower validation loss in the infinite data regime, but then it also trains for a lot longer, it's not clear why I had to come in to point that out). They are very good at implementing any given well-scoped and described idea but they don't creatively generate them.\n\nBut the goal is that you are now programming an organization (e.g. a \"research org\") and its individual agents, so the \"source code\" is the collection of prompts, skills, tools, etc. and processes that make it up. E.g. a daily standup in the morning is now part of the \"org code\". And optimizing nanochat pretraining is just one of the many tasks (almost like an eval). Then - given an arbitrary task, how quickly does your research org generate progress on it?",

    "text": "This is not an extension of the November deal. It is a fundamentally different relationship.\n\nThe November 2025 agreement was straightforward. OpenAI committed $38 billion over seven years to rent NVIDIA GPU capacity on AWS. EC2 UltraServers, GB200s and GB300s, pure infrastructure-as-a-service. No equity. No product co-development. No custom silicon. It was OpenAI’s first big move away from Microsoft exclusivity, and AWS was happy to take the revenue.\n\nToday’s announcement is a full strategic partnership with at least six dimensions the first deal never touched.\n\nFirst, equity. Amazon is investing $50 billion in OpenAI. $15 billion upfront, $35 billion conditional on an IPO or AGI milestone. That changes the incentive structure entirely. Amazon now has skin in OpenAI’s success as a company, not just as a compute customer.\nSecond, Trainium. OpenAI is committing to consume 2 gigawatts of Trainium capacity, covering both Trainium3 and next-generation Trainium4. In November, the deal was explicitly NVIDIA-only. AWS couldn’t even discuss Trainium in the context of OpenAI. This is the single biggest validation of Amazon’s custom AI silicon strategy to date, and it gives OpenAI a real hedge against NVIDIA supply constraints and pricing power.\n\nThird, product co-development. The two companies are jointly building a Stateful Runtime Environment powered by OpenAI models, available through Amazon Bedrock. Stateful environments are where enterprise AI is heading. Context persistence, memory, tool access, compute integration. This is not renting servers. This is co-engineering the next layer of the AI stack.\n\nFourth, exclusive distribution. AWS becomes the exclusive third-party cloud distribution provider for OpenAI Frontier, their enterprise agent platform. This *looks* like a competitive lockout against Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud for enterprise AI agent deployment.\n\nFifth, custom models. OpenAI and Amazon will develop customized models to power Amazon’s consumer-facing applications. Alexa, Rufus, and whatever comes next. This puts OpenAI directly into Amazon’s product stack, not just its infrastructure.\n\nSixth, scale. The deal expands the original $38 billion agreement by $100 billion over eight years.\n\nThree things I am watching:\n\nThe Trainium bet is the most strategically significant piece. If OpenAI runs meaningful frontier workloads on Trainium3 and Trainium4, it validates Amazon’s custom silicon roadmap in a way that no other customer endorsement could. It also pressures NVIDIA’s pricing leverage with hyperscalers. M\n\nThe Anthropic dynamic is complicated. Amazon now holds deep strategic investments in both OpenAI and Anthropic. On paper, that is the smartest hedge in AI. In practice, it creates real tension around resource allocation, Trainium prioritization, and Bedrock positioning. Anthropic was supposed to be AWS’s flagship AI partner. That narrative just got a lot more nuanced.\n\nThe Microsoft relationship is interesting. Microsoft remains OpenAI’s largest shareholder and primary cloud partner. But the exclusive distribution rights for Frontier on AWS, the Trainium commitment, and the custom model development for Amazon products all represent meaningful competitive erosion for Azure. $AMZN $MSFT $NVDA $AMD",

This is the Windows 11 cycle plus premium and commercial mix.\n• AI PCs were over 35% of shipments, up from 30% last quarter. The question is whether that translates to sustained ASP and attach, not just unit mix. Probably not.\n• Printing still drags the growth profile: $4.19B (-2% YoY) with hardware units down 6%. The long-term fix is more software, services, and managed print, not boxes.\n• Memory costs are the margin challenge: management expects volatility to persist into next year and is guiding FY26 closer to the low end. That is a cost headwind, not a Q1 demand problem.\n\nWatching:\n• Pass-through on memory cost in consumer PCs without losing share as promotions intensify.\n• Commercial refresh durability: if PC units decline double digits, mix and pricing have to do the margin work.",
